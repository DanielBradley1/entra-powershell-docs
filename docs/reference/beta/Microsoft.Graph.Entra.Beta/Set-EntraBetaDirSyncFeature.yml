  The Set-EntraBetaDirSyncFeature cmdlet is used to turn identity synchronization features on or off for 
  a tenant.
  Features that can be used with this cmdlet include:

      SynchronizeUpnForManagedUsers- allows for the synchronization of UserPrincipalName updates from on-premises for managed (non-federated) users that have been assigned a license.
  These updates will be blocked if this feature is not enabled.
  Once this feature is enabled it cannot be disabled.

      EnableSoftMatchOnUpn- Soft Match is the process used to link an object being synced from on-premises for the first time with one that already exists in the cloud.
  When this feature is enabled Soft Match will first be attempted using the standard logic, based on primary SMTP address.
  If a match is not found based on primary SMTP, then a match will be attempted based on UserPrincipalName.
  Once this feature is enabled it cannot be disabled.

      DuplicateUPNResiliency (preview)- normally if a user was attempted to be provisioned with a non-unique UserPrincipalName, the user would fail to be created/updated due to the uniqueness violation.
  When this feature is enabled the conflicting UPN value will be â€œquarantinedâ€, a temporary UPN will be generated, and the user will be provisioned with that temporary UPN.
  This UPN will have the format of "\<UserName\>+\<Random Integer\>@\<Tenant Initial Domain\>.onmicrosoft.com".

      DuplicateProxyAddressResiliency (preview)- normally if an object was attempted to be provisioned with a non-unique ProxyAddress, the object would fail to be created/updated due to the uniqueness violation.
  When this feature is enabled the conflicting ProxyAddress value will be â€œquarantinedâ€ and the object will be provisioned without that specific ProxyAddress value.
